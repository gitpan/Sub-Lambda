Sub-Lambda (0.2)

The module provides syntactic sugar for lambda expressions in Perl. With
Sub::Lambda you gain the convenient fn subroutine:

  (fn x => fn y => '$x-$y')->(1)->(2) # -1

Also, there is an experimental Sub::Lambda::Filter that goes one step
beyond that and lets you write:

  (\x -> \y -> {$x-$y})->(1)->(2) #3

  ((\f -> \a -> \b -> f b a) (\x -> \y -> {$x-$y}) {1} {2}) # 1

See the POD documentation for more examples.
